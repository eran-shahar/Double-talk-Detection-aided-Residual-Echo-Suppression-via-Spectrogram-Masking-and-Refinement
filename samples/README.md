Some examples to demonstrate the system's performance.  
Samples 1-2 are near-end only utternaces.  
Samples 3-4 are far-end only utterances.  
Samples 5-12 are double-talk utterances.  

Note the since the double-talk utternaces' SER is very low, it is recommnded to use head-phones / play the samples with high volume (but not the 'mic' files, since these will be very loud).
